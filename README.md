## Game Rules

- Enter a word or phrase in the input field and click "Start Game" to begin.

- Each incorrect guess will display a part of the hangman.
- You win the game if you guess the word or phrase correctly before the hangman is complete.
- You lose the game if the hangman is complete before you guess the word or phrase.
